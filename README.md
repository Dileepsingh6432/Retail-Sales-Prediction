# Retail-Sales-Prediction
The objective of this project is to forecast or predict the sales. This is based on a Rossman Store's Data, and we use different regression algorithms to predict the sales.
# Introduction
Rossman operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossman store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossman stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set.
